# 06-Weather-Dashboard

## Description

- The motivation for this project was derived from the idea of a weather dashboard.
- This project was structured to practice the usage of third-party API's.
- During this project I learned how to make API calls and render them in my website.

## User-Story

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view the weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
